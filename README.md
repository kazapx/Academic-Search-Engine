# Academic-Search-Engine
First of all I'm sorry that there is no "requirements.txt". I started this project without virtual environment so i couldn't create a requirements.txt afterwards.
We can say that project is like the https://dblp.org/ website. You can search authors, journals. I used Neo4j database.  </br>   </br> 
You have to care about apoc.load.xml. Some cloud like auradb have not support for apoc.load.xml. You can check here apoc support for auradb "https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/apoc/"
There is no support so be careful. If you want to test locally I recommend neo4j desktop.  </br>
You can access admin panel with "/admin".
